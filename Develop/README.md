## What I looked for in the project
    In this project, the first thing I did when cloned the starter code was to review the guide
     lines of what needed to be changed.

    I immediatly noticed things such as the need to change "div" classes to fit the semantic rules
     of HTML. Another part of the code that jumped out at me was the need to add "alt" attributes
      to images for accesibility. 
## What I did to change the project
    After my initial review of the checklist, I had immediatly went onto the process of elimination. 

    When changing code such as changing the "div" classes to fit the semantic rules of HTML, I
     would actively change the CSS files to view what I was changing, and how to correct it.
      After a single change of code. I would refresh my webpage to view the results of the changes.

    One of the more difficult parts of this project was the background image element. As it was
     initially part of the CSS file, I needed to add an "alt" attribute to fit the accesability
      requirement. During learning about changing my image element to HTML, I found out that it
       would likely be the better option for future images, as it could impact the performance
        of the webpage to properly load.

## What I did to review the project
    When reviewing my project I made sure to save frequiently and refresh my web-browser. As
     with any change in the code, it could either make the website, or break it.

    Another part that I did as a part of experimentation would be to create a copy of my
     current file, and change bits of pieces to see what they affected without ruining my
      progress from before.

## Would there be any thing I would change
    If there were to be any personaly changes to this project, it would be add some ":root:"
     color elements, as I find them to be a neat way of tracking color schemes.

    Another thing that I would change would be to make the text have a dynamic size according
     to the size of the webpage. I would add in the "font-size: 1.1vw" elemnt to the css,
      however I am unsure as to how that would be viewed on mobile devices, as it could break
       the view.
